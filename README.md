 ## Excel Documtnt(Workbook) :
 - In excel we have excel file in that excel file we have work book inside workbook there are worksheets that represents our excel file.
 
 - We can also keep week tracker data in our sheet1 and 2nd week data in sheet2 and so on.

  #### Filling data in excel sheet : 

- We can fill data in excel in format of cell and cell represent as A1,A2,B10 etc.

- We can fill data in different format just like in text and numeric. Text format is alligned left side of the cell and numberic alligned right side of cell.

- If we click on cell and if there is green triangle at top left side of cell it means something wrong with that text.

#### Cell Refrances:

- Cell referred as A3,B3,B5 etc.
- Range of cell C4:C8.
- If we want to refer entire table start C3:F10.
####  Creating Basic formulas in Excel :
1. Sum:
- If we want to do lot of calculations in excel we can do it by using cell refrance.
     - =sum(B1+B2+B3+B4)


- We have two types of cell refrances. Relative cell refrence and absolute refrance.
1. Relavtive cell refrance:
- If we copy cell that has perfomed the calculation and have some formulas and we paste that in another cell it will keep formula same but will give refrance of that to perform same calculations.
- You can creat a formula i.e relative refrance and copy in the cell where you need it
2. Absolute refrance- 
- Relative refrance gives exact same refrance i.e pattern.
- Absolute cell refrance keeps one value same and changes refrance of cell.
- We just need to add $ sign before and in middle so excel keep that value same but change other cell refrance.C4/$D$9

#### Order Of Operations : 
- Order of operation is BODMAS like math so we need to take care of that before executing that, we can also evaluate our formulas by click formuls> evaluate formula.

#### Structure Of Excel Function:
 - Every function has three parts.
 - We need to start the function by = sign , type function name like add div sub and then give arguments in paranthesis(range of cells).
     - =SUM(B4:B5)


- Fx: is argument window that will help us to find out what cells we have used for calculations.

1. Auto sum function:
- it adds automatically selected column and we will get addition at the end of cell.

2. Recently use : Get quick access to recently used function

3. Financial : Helps to do financial calculations

4. Logical functions :  Adds logical functions to cell like AND, IF ,OR etc.

5. Text function: Helps with text formatiing like finding text , replace text etc.

6. Date and time : This helps to add date, time, hour etc to function.
7. Lookup and refrances : Helps to add lookup and refrance to excel VLOOKUP etc.
8. Math and trignometry:  Helps to do numeric calculations in that.
- There are lot of functions that we can add.
